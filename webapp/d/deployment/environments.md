At Stoic Dreams, we practice [CASE: Continuous Agile Software Engineering](https://www.softwarestandards.dev/continuous-agile-software-engineering) for developing all of our projects. This allows us to iterate and deploy quickly, moving directly from local development environments to production in an automated manner.
