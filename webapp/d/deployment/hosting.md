## CDN Hosting

We welcome the use of Stoic Dreams' CDN for hosting your Web UI assets. This ensures fast and reliable access for all users, with automatic versioning and caching.

To use the CDN, simply follow our examples within this site.

## Self Hosting

If you prefer to self-host your Web UI assets, you can clone our [MyFi CDN](https://github.com/StoicDreams/MyFiCDN).

In the future, we will create documentation and tools to make self-hosting even easier.
