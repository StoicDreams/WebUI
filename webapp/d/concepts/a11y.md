We believe that accessibility is a fundamental aspect of user experience. And we are committed to making our components as accessible as possible.

That said, we do not currently incorporate accessibility testing into our development process. We encourage users to perform their own testing and provide feedback to help us improve.

Over time, we plan to integrate more comprehensive accessibility checks and balances into our workflow to ensure our components meet the highest standards of inclusivity.
