Web UI is built around a modular architecture that promotes reusability and maintainability. Key concepts include:

- **Loader.js:** The entry point for loading and initializing components, managing dependencies and ensuring a smooth startup process.
- **Managed Navigation:** A system for handling navigation between different views and states within the application, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Components:** Self-contained units of functionality that can be easily reused across the application.
- **Data Binding:** A global mechanism that connects the UI components to the underlying data model, ensuring that changes in the model are reflected in the UI and vice versa.

This architecture enables developers to create complex UIs by composing simple, reusable components.
