Performance is a critical aspect of any web application, and Web UI is designed with performance in mind. Key considerations include:

- **Lazy Loading:** Loading only the necessary resources and data when they are needed, rather than all at once, to improve initial load times and reduce resource consumption.
- **Code Splitting:** Breaking up large bundles of code into smaller, more manageable chunks that can be loaded on demand, improving performance and reducing the time to interactive.
- **Optimized Rendering:** Apply data updates directly to the UI without unnecessary re-renders, improving responsiveness and reducing CPU usage.
- **Data Caching:** A strategy for storing frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need for repeated network requests and improving application performance.
