Web UI is designed to work seamlessly with various data sources and APIs, enabling developers to create dynamic and responsive applications. Key concepts include:

- **Data Models:** Represent the structure and behavior of the data used in the application, providing a clear contract for how components interact with the data.
- **Data Fetching:** A set of utilities for retrieving data from APIs or other sources, including support for caching, pagination, and real-time updates.
- **State Management:** A centralized system for managing the application state, ensuring that all components have access to the latest data and can react to changes.
- **Error Handling:** A robust mechanism for managing errors and exceptions that may occur during data fetching or processing, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Real-time Updates:** Support for pushing updates to the UI in real-time as data changes, enabling a more dynamic and responsive user experience.
- **Data Caching:** A strategy for storing frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need for repeated network requests and improving application performance.
- **Pagination:** A technique for dividing large datasets into smaller, manageable chunks, improving performance and user experience when displaying data.
