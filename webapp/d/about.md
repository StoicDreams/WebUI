Web UI is a collection of Web Components written entirely in Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

We are also working on a Rust crate wrapper that will allow developers to write specific services to process data or handle tasks in Rust that will run as WebAssembly in the browser. Our vision here is to allow communication between the Rust WebAssembly services and your JavaScript code and/or the Web UI app services.
