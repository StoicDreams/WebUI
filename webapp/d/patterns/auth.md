Web UI natively supports a role-based access control system, allowing you to define and manage user roles and permissions easily.

We are currently working on integrating this Role system through our [My Fidelity](https://www.stoicdreams.com/myfi-services) platform. But we will also provide documentation on how to integrate this using other systems.

The use of roles is optional, in case you want to implement your own access control logic through your server APIs.
