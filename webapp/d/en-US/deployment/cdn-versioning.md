Web UI is currently in pre-release with no stable versioning yet. Updates will be communicated through the project's repository and [release notes](/changelog).

## CDN Hosting

When versioning is implemented, all stable versions will be hosted on our CDN server(s), ensuring fast and reliable access for all users.

## Versioning Strategy

Web UI will adopt semantic versioning (SemVer) principles to ensure clear and predictable versioning. This means:

- **Major versions** will introduce breaking changes and require users to update their code.
- **Minor versions** will add new features in a backward-compatible manner.
- **Patch versions** will include bug fixes and minor improvements.

## Beta

The main loader and Web UI files will be our Beta version, where all new features and improvements will be tested before being released to a stable version. All Stoic Dreams websites will use this beta version to help assure compatibility and performance.

## Version Update Strategy

We are still working out how exactly version updates will be handled, but the goal is to provide a smooth and predictable update experience for all users. This may include:

- Clear communication of upcoming changes and deprecations.
- Robust documentation providing clear guidance on migration paths and best practices.
- A well-defined process for users to report issues and request features.
- Regularly scheduled updates to ensure the library remains up-to-date and secure.
