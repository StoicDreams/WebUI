Web UI components are designed to be easily styled and customized. Here are some key concepts and best practices for styling Web UI components:

- **CSS Variables:** Use CSS variables to define reusable values for colors, fonts, and other design tokens. This makes it easy to maintain a consistent look and feel across your application.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure that your components are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. Use media queries and flexible layouts to create a seamless experience across devices.
- **Theming:** Leverage theming capabilities to allow for easy customization of the application's appearance. This can include light/dark mode switches, as well as support for user-defined themes.
