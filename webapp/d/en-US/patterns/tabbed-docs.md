<webui-data data-page-title="Tabbed Docs Page" data-page-subtitle=""></webui-data>

Tabbed content is a great way to organize information and allow users to switch between different views or sections without leaving the page. This pattern is especially useful for displaying related content, such as documentation, settings, or product features.

Web UI provides a simple way to implement tabbed content using the `<webui-tabs>` component. This component allows you to define multiple tabs, each with its own content, and switch between them seamlessly.
